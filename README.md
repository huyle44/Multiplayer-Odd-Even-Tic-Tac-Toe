## ðŸŽ® The Game Rules

Before we dive into the distributed systems concepts, let's understand the game you're building:

**Setup:**

- 5x5 board (25 squares)
- All squares start at 0
- First player is the **Odd Player**, second player is the **Even Player**

**Gameplay:**

- Click any square to increment its number by 1 (0â†’1â†’2â†’3â†’4...)
- Both players can click any square at any time (no turns!)
- Multiple clicks on the same square keep incrementing it

**Winning:**

- **Odd Player wins** if any row, column, or diagonal has all 5 odd numbers
    - Example: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] or [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
- **Even Player wins** if any row, column, or diagonal has all 5 even numbers
    - Example: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] or [4, 6, 8, 8, 8]

**Strategy:**

- Odd player clicks squares to make/keep them odd
- Even player clicks squares to make/keep them even
- Fighting over the same squares is the game!
- If both players click a square with 5, it becomes 7 (stays odd)
- If both players click a square with 4, it becomes 6 (stays even)
